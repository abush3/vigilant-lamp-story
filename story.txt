Alex's Story:

Once upon a time there a CS student named Alex. He was very good at working with Linux and helping his teammate learn how to use this platform. His teammate Jon, whom is a bit older, especially needed extra help. After helping Jon figure out how to use Linux terminal commands better, Alex went to eat dinner at a great local restaurant and had a great evening. 

Everything was going great for Alex at that moment. He thought to himself "wow. life doesn't get any better than this!" Everything was just going as planned for Alex, but little did he know....
