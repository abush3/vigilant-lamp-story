Alex's Story:

Once upon a time there a CS student named Alex. He was very good at working 
with Linux and helping his teammate learn how to use this platform. His 
teammate Jon, whom is a bit older, especially needed extra help. 
After helping Jon figure out how to use Linux terminal commands better, 
Alex went to eat dinner at a great local restaurant and had a great evening. 

Everything was going great for Alex at that moment. He thought to himself 
"wow. life doesn't get any better than this!" Everything was just going as 
planned for Alex, but little did he know....

A string of words were plummeting from the sky and there was the faint
 roar of a bear. Alex was confused, but he quickly decided to focus on 
making his day better. He decided to start going back to maybe play 
some video games or get some sleep. 

Then Alex woke up. He realized that it was only a dream and he was not actually
that good at using linux and needs to practice more. He decided that he should
play around in other peoples file systems just incase he made a mistake. 
Eventually he ended up recursively deleting all the files on his brothers 
computer. To avoid having his brother realize his mistake, he burned and hid
the laptop so his brother would never know it was all his fault.


The End
